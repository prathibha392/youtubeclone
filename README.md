This project presents the development of a YouTube Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing solely on the frontend interface. 
The clone replicates YouTubeâ€™s essential UI elements, including a responsive video gallery, a navigation sidebar, a search bar, and interactive video thumbnails. 
The design is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactive elements such as dynamic search functionality, video playback simulation, and user interface animations.
While this project does not include backend functionality, it serves as a strong foundation for understanding modern web development, UI/UX principles, and responsive design techniques.
